0,fet3,YMR058W,cellular response to iron ion starvation,"SC5
Iron ion
transport","Ferro-O2-oxidoreductase; multicopper oxidase that oxidizes ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) for subsequent cellular uptake by transmembrane permease Ftr1p; required for high-affinity iron uptake and involved in mediating resistance to copper ion toxicity, belongs to class of integral membrane multicopper oxidases; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress"
1,aft1,YGL071W,cellular response to iron ion starvation,"SC5
Iron ion
transport","Transcription factor involved in iron utilization and homeostasis; binds consensus site PyPuCACCCPu and activates transcription in response to changes in iron availability; in iron-replete conditions localization is regulated by Grx3p, Grx4p, and Fra2p, and promoter binding is negatively regulated via Grx3p-Grx4p binding; AFT1 has a paralog, AFT2, that arose from the whole genome duplication; relative distribution to the nucleus increases upon DNA replication stress"
2,dal81,YIR023W,phenylalanine transport,"SC9
