--------

This repo contains a Snakefile and thus all pipeline can be run using Snakemake. 

Snakemake will use the raw data provided under `data/raw` to generate all intermediate data and results for figure generation.

Raw data could be downloaded from `https://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/data_files/Genetic%20interaction%20profile%20similarity%20matrices.zip`

Necessary files for Gene Ontology analysis were downloaded from Gene ontology consortium or from SGD on May 20, 2021.

Following links could be used and should be placed under `data/raw/ontology`: 

```
https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/curation/chromosomal_feature/SGD_features.tab

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/go-basic.obo

http://current.geneontology.org/annotations/sgd.gaf.gz
```

The Rmarkdown and Jupyter notebooks under `notebooks` directory can be used to create the figures in the paper. The html files for those notebooks are shared under `reports_done` folder. A rerun of snakemake pipeline will create `html` files to `reports` folder.

To re-create the figures/reports starting from raw data, first create a conda environment and install snakemake:

```bash
conda create -n enm_package_env
conda activate enm_package_env
conda install snakemake
```

Then run snakemake:

```bash
snakemake -j10 --use-conda --conda-frontend conda all
```

This will run rules based on the following DAG:
![Snakemake DAG](dag.png)

`--use-conda --conda-frontend` directive will download and install necessary packages and run the scripts in a conda environment for both python/jupyter and r/rmarkdown files. Figure 2 and Figure 5 dependencies will take longer to run, depending on cpu and number of cores. I don't suggest running them blindly. 

Alternatively, it is also possible to use interim data generated in the project to regenerate figures. `Snakefile_with_supp` will use data available in `data/supp` folder to regenerate Figure2 to Figure 5, except network figures.

```bash
snakemake -s Snakefile_with_supp -j10 --use-conda --conda-frontend conda 
```

Finally, one can also create a conda environment with following, change the input file names in scripts and notebooks manually and run them manually. This is not suggested.

```bash
conda env create -n enm_package_env -f enm_snakemake.yml
```
